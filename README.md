## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
The purpose of this assignment is to get the serial monitor to print "Hello World"

```python
from time import sleep

while True:
    print("Hello World!") ##Prints "Hello World!" to the serial monitor
    sleep(1)

```

### Wiring

The wiring of this assignment is quite literally just plugging in the board into one of the USB ports on the Computer

### Reflection

The hardest part about this assignment is trying to set up visual studio code to make it compatible with everything. It was also the very first time I had ever touched circuit python, and the language was very different to what I was used to; Arduino language. 




## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code

The purpose of this assignment is to make a servo move using the Adafruit metro board

import time
import board
import pwmio
from adafruit_motor import servo

# create a PWMOut object on Pin A2.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.D3, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

while True:
    for angle in range(0, 180, 10):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)
    for angle in range(180, 0, -10): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)

### Reflection

Adding a servo to the complexity of the code was a bit tricky, as the terminology was very different and new to me, but again, google came to help. The only tricky part really was having to move files from one lib folder to another, to allow the motor to actually spin. If I was to do this assignment again, I would definitely research servos more, to help with my knowledge of the functions of the motor. 



## CircuitPython_LCD

The purpose of this assignment is to turn the neopixel different colors corresponding to the distance measured on the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. We want neopixel to turn red when your object is less than 5cm, blue when between 5 and 20cm, and green when farther than 20cm. Simultaneously, the distance is being printed on the serial monitor.

### Reflection

The process to complete this assignment was very much similar to the Servo assignment, where all I had to do was copy some code down into my Visual Studio Code app, mess around with some of the colors, and move some files from, again, one lib folder to another. One thing I would do differently would be to try some easier solutions to the code. I just feel like the code I was using was too long for itâ€™s purpose.
