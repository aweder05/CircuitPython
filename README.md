### Reflection

The hardest part about this assignment is trying to set up visual studio code to make it compatible with everything. It was also the very first time I had ever touched circuit python, and the language was very different to what I was used to; Arduino language. 




## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code

The purpose of this assignment is to make a servo move using the Adafruit metro board 

```python
import board                       #[1-16] Setup for Buttons                 
import time                        #And servo
import math
import pwmio 
from adafruit_motor import servo
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull
btn = DigitalInOut(board.D3)
btn2 = DigitalInOut(board.D2)
btn.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn2.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn.pull = Pull.UP
btn2.pull = Pull.UP

pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.D5, duty_cycle=2 **15, frequency=50)
myServo = servo.Servo(pwm)

print("starting") 
while True:                 #[17-27]If a button is pressed
    print("re")             #Rotate to either 180 or 0
    if btn.value == True:
        myServo.angle = 180
        time.sleep(1)
        print("Right")
    elif btn2.value == True :
        myServo.angle = 0
        time.sleep(1)
        print("Left")
```

### Reflection

Adding a servo to the complexity of the code was a bit tricky, as the terminology was very different and new to me, but again, google came to help. The only tricky part really was having to move files from one lib folder to another, to allow the motor to actually spin. If I was to do this assignment again, I would definitely research servos more, to help with my knowledge of the functions of the motor. 



## CircuitPython_DistanceSensor

The purpose of this assignment is to turn the neopixel different colors corresponding to the distance measured on the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. We want neopixel to turn red when your object is less than 5cm, blue when between 5 and 20cm, and green when farther than 20cm. Simultaneously, the distance is being printed on the serial monitor.

### Reflection

The process to complete this assignment was very much similar to the Servo assignment, where all I had to do was copy some code down into my Visual Studio Code app, mess around with some of the colors, and move some files from, again, one lib folder to another. One thing I would do differently would be to try some easier solutions to the code. I just feel like the code I was using was too long for itâ€™s purpose.

## LCD Backpack Button Counter with Toggle Feature

The purpose of this assignment was to wire two buttons and an LCD backpack to a breadboard. Each time pushing the button wired to the digital 3 pin, the counter on the LCD would increase by one. But, when holding down the button wired to the digital 2 pin, and then pressing the other button while holding down the first one, the counter would decrease by one. All of this is printed on the liquid crystal display (LCD) backpack.

### Description & Code

```python
import board
import time
from lcd.lcd import LCD
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull

# get and i2c object
i2c = board.I2C()
btn = DigitalInOut(board.D3)
btn2 = DigitalInOut(board.D2)
btn.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn.pull = Pull.UP
btn2.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn2.pull = Pull.UP
# some LCDs are 0x3f... some are 0x27.
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)
cur_state = True
prev_state = True
cur_state2 = True
prev_state2 = True
buttonPress = 0

while True:
    while btn2.value == False:
        cur_state = btn.value
        if cur_state != prev_state:
            if not cur_state:
                buttonPress = buttonPress + 1
                lcd.clear()
                lcd.set_cursor_pos(0,0)
                lcd.print(str(buttonPress))
            else:
                lcd.clear()
                lcd.set_cursor_pos(0,0)
                lcd.print(str(buttonPress))
        prev_state = cur_state
    else:
        cur_state2 = btn.value
        if cur_state2 != prev_state2:
            if not cur_state2:
                buttonPress = buttonPress - 1
                lcd.clear()
                lcd.set_cursor_pos(0,0)
                lcd.print(str(buttonPress))
            else:
                lcd.clear()
                lcd.set_cursor_pos(0,0)
                lcd.print(str(buttonPress))
        prev_state2 = cur_state2

## CircuitPython Motor-Control

The purpose of this assignment was to use a Metro Express board to use a potentiometer to determine the speed at which a DC Motor spins. This was accomplished by determining a set range of values at which the DC motor turns on and starts spinning. Then, the more that the potentiometer turns, the faster the motor spins. The motor is being powered by a battery pack, and the potentiometer is powered by the board. 

### Description and Code

```python
import time
import board
import simpleio
from analogio import AnalogIn 
import pwmio  

analog_in = AnalogIn(board.A2) #potentionmeter pin
pin_out = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A1,duty_cycle=65535,frequency=5000)
print("Hello!!")


while True:

    sensor_value = analog_in.value
    # Map the sensor's range from 0<=sensor_value<=255 to 0<=sensor_value<=1023
    mapped_value = int(simpleio.map_range(sensor_value, 0, 65535, 0, 255))

    pin_out.duty_cycle = sensor_value
    print("mapped sensor value: ", sensor_value)
    time.sleep(0.15) 
```

### Reflection 

This assignment was very frustrating, but not because the actual assignment was difficult. It was difficult because after switching from one computer to another, everything got messed up, causing a multitude of problems. After fixing all of that, I saw that my wiring was messed up because the diagram I was using was with an Arduino, which powered the potentiometer with 5 volts, when I actually just needed to power it with 3.3. Me not being an expert at wiring, fixing everything and making it work turned out to be a tedious and frustrating process, but in the end, the biggest lesson that I learned from completing this assignment is persistence, and to ask a whole lot of damn questions.

## CircuitPython Temperature Sensor

### Description

To use a Temperature Sensor and LCD Screen to print the current temperature on line 1 of the LCD screen. 
Then on line 2 print a message for the following scenarios: 
    - If the temperature is within a desired range, print a message "It feels great in here"
    - If it is too cold, print "brrr Too Cold!"
    - If it is too hot, print "Too Hot!"
    
### Code

```python
import board   #[Lines 1-8] Importing all Neccessary libraries to communicate with LCD
import time
from lcd.lcd import LCD
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull
import board
import analogio


# get and i2c object
i2c = board.I2C()
tmp36 = analogio.AnalogIn(board.A0)
# some LCDs are 0x3f... some are 0x27.
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)
def tmp36_temperature_C(analogin):              #Convert millivolts to temperature
    millivolts = analogin.value * (analogin.reference_voltage * 1000 / 65535)
    return (millivolts - 500) / 10


while True:
    # Read the temperature in Celsius.
    temp_C = tmp36_temperature_C(tmp36)  
    # Convert to Fahrenheit.
    temp_F = (temp_C * 9/5) + 32
    # Print out the value and delay a second before looping again.
    lcd.set_cursor_pos(0, 0)           #[Lines 26-36] Print different messages based on the temperature
    if temp_F > 75:
        lcd.print("it's too hot!")
    elif temp_F < 70:
        lcd.print("it's too cold")
    else:
        lcd.print("It's just right")
    lcd.set_cursor_pos(1, 0)
    lcd.print("Temp: {}F".format(temp_F))
    time.sleep(.5)
```

### Reflection

The hardest part about this project was definitely figuring out how to make the LCD screen work. Ive gotten it to work in the past, but with the temperature sensor, it's very difficult to get power to the LCD screen and then on top of that make it finally print something else. Wiring was very simple, and could be figured out with two quick google searches. The code, on the other hand, was impossible for me, as is most everything else that uses Visual Studio code. All code credit goes to Kazuo Shinozaki. The only coding I did was a little bit of tweaking here and there to get the LCD work at the desired outcome.

encoder = rotaryio.IncrementalEncoder(board.D10, board.D9, 2)
last_position = None
while True:
    position = encoder.position
    if last_position is None or position != last_position:
        lcd.clear()
        lcd.print(colors[position % len(colors)][0])
    if(not button.value):
        led[0] = colors[position % len(colors)][1]
    last_position = position
