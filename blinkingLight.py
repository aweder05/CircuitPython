As my first Circuit Python Assignment, the hardest part was setting up Visual Studio code to be compatible with the board that weâ€™re using. 
Other than that, the code was very simple and I pretty much got most of it from the internet. 
What I would do differently next time would be to follow directions more closely and more logically. 
It would save a lot of time and would help me budget more time into trying to do other things with the assignments. 


import board
import neopixel
import time 
import math 

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)
dot.brightness = 0.1 #sets the brightness level of the LED

print("Make it red!") #prints "" onto the serial monitor

while True: #coontinuously blinks a red led, with 2/10 second intervals
    dot.fill((255, 0, 0))
    time.sleep (0.2)
    dot.fill((0, 0, 255))
    time.sleep (0.2)
